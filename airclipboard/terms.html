    <h1 class="mb-4 fw-bold">ɅirClipboard – Terms of Service</h1>

    <p>These Terms govern your use of the ɅirClipboard app, available exclusively for macOS.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-5">1. App Usage</h2>
    <p>
      ɅirClipboard is a clipboard manager for macOS. By using the app, you agree to use it lawfully and in accordance with these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">2. Versions & Limitations</h2>
    <p>
      A free version is available with limited features (e.g., history limited to 3 items). Pro versions are offered through one-time purchase or monthly subscription, depending on the selected license.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">3. Licensing</h2>
    <p>
      Licenses are personal, tied to an email address, and must not be shared. License validation occurs locally on the device — no data is sent externally.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">4. Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      ɅirClipboard does not collect or store user data on external servers. All clipboard content remains stored locally on your device.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">5. Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>
      Since the app offers both a free version and trial period, refunds are generally not provided once a license is activated. For special cases, contact us at <a href="mailto:airclipboardapp@gmail.com">airclipboardapp@gmail.com</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">6. Modifications</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms may be updated from time to time. It is your responsibility to review them periodically.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">7. Contact</h2>
    <p>
      For questions or requests, please contact us at <a href="mailto:airclipboardapp@gmail.com">airclipboardapp@gmail.com</a>.
