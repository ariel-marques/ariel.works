    <p>This Refund Policy explains how refunds are handled for ɅirClipboard licenses.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">1. Try Before You Buy</h2>
    <p>ɅirClipboard offers a free version and a trial period to let users evaluate the app before purchasing a license.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">2. Refund Eligibility</h2>
    <p>We follow Paddle's standard refund policy, which allows customers to request a refund within 14 days of purchase, as outlined in Paddle's Buyer Terms of Use.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">3. No Refunds After 14 Days</h2>
    <p>After 14 days from the date of purchase, refunds are generally not available. Within the 14-day period, customers may request a refund even if the license has been activated, in accordance with Paddle's Buyer Terms.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">4. Technical Issues</h2>
    <p>If you encounter a technical issue that prevents the proper use of the app, please contact us. We are happy to assist or, if necessary, process a refund within the applicable timeframe.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">5. Contact</h2>
    <p>To request support or a refund, contact us at <a href="mailto:airclipboardapp@gmail.com">airclipboardapp@gmail.com</a>.</p>
