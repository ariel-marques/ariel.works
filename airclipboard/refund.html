    <p>This Refund Policy explains how refunds are handled for ɅirClipboard licenses sold via Paddle.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">1. Try Before You Buy</h2>
    <p>ɅirClipboard offers a free version and a trial period to allow users to evaluate the application before purchasing a license.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">2. Refund Eligibility</h2>
    <p>We follow Paddle's standard refund policy, which allows customers to request a refund within 14 days of purchase, as outlined in Paddle's Buyer Terms of Use.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">3. No Refunds After Activation</h2>
    <p>Once a license key has been activated and the application fully unlocked, refunds may not be issued unless a technical issue prevents proper use of the app.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">4. How to Request a Refund</h2>
    <p>If you encounter an issue or wish to request a refund, please contact us at <a href="mailto:airclipboardapp@gmail.com">airclipboardapp@gmail.com</a> within 14 days of your purchase. We will do our best to resolve any problem or issue a refund if eligible.</p>
